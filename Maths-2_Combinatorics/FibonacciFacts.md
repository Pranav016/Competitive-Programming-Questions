# Zeckendorfâ€™s theorem
states that every positive integer can be written uniquely as a sum of distinct non-neighbouring Fibonacci numbers. Two Fibonacci numbers are neighbours if they one come after other in Fibonacci Sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..). 


Input:  n = 30
Output: 21 8 1
21, 8 and 1 are non-consecutive Fibonacci Numbers
and sum of them is 30.

# Pisano Period
Last 1/2/3/4 digits of a fibonacci no. repeat with a period of 60/300/1500/15000 respt.
